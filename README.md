This Project is a spam detector that uses an unigram approach to filter out incoming spams by counting
every word and then associated with whether an email is spam or not.
The program can be trained using old emails that may or may not be spam and will calculate how accurate/precise
the current version is.
The accuracy and the precision are determined by the training data.
